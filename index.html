    <h2>Understanding Stoic Values</h2>
    <p class="p1" >Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It was heavily influenced by certain teachings of <span style="font-size:1.2em;"><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates"  class="text"> Socrates </a> </span> , while stoic physics are largely drawn from the teachings of the philosopher <span style="font-size:1.2em;"><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus"  class="text">Heraclitus </a> </span> . Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting this moment as it presents itself, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.</p>

    <h3>Marcus Aurelius</h3>
    <p class="p1"> The philosophy of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius can be found in a collection of personal writings known as the Meditations. These reflect the influence of Stoicism and, in particular, the philosophy of Epictetus, the Stoic. The Meditations may be read as a series of practical philosophical exercises, following Epictetus' three topics of study, designed to digest and put into practice philosophical theory. Central to these exercises is a concern with the analysis of one's judgements and a desire to cultivate a "cosmic perspective."</p>

    <h2>Life Can Be Cruel</h2>
    <p>And that's <b>okay</b>! Stocism can be percieved as a "negative" philosophy. It's a philosophy that preaches grim endurance, carrying on rather than getting over, and tolerating rather than transcending life’s agonies and adversities.Any misfortune ‘that lies outside the sphere of choice’ should be considered an opportunity to strengthen our resolve, not an excuse to weaken it. You <b> can</b> make it, and you <b> will</b> be alright.</p>
